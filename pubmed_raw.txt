AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer with improved 
      survival rates due to advances in treatment, including stem cell transplantation, 
      chemotherapy, and drug therapy. However, cognitive impact of therapies remains 
      unclear. This study aimed to systematically review cognition in patients with MM 
      across treatment pathways and estimate overall effects to determine whether 
      patients experienced cognitive changes after treatment initiation. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, and 
      Google Scholar for full-text English articles from 2000 to 2024, aligned with the 
      era of new treatment advances. The review included longitudinal studies and 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on cognition and quality of life in patients 
      with MM treated via three common pathways. Measures included objective tools like 
      the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and self-reported questionnaires like 
      the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
      Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). Two reviewers independently extracted data 
      and assessed study bias. The meta-analyses examined cognitive changes from 
      baseline up to six months from the start of treatment. This duration was 
      identified due to being an intensive phase in MM therapy. RESULTS: Eighteen 
      studies (N = 5843) were reviewed, and eight (N = 3602) contributed to the 
      meta-analysis. The risk of bias analysis revealed a potential self-selection bias 
      in participant recruitment onto studies, meaning sample populations may not be 
      representative of the MM community. The meta-analysis revealed a significant 
      cognitive decline from baseline across all treatment during the first six months 
      of treatment (standardized mean difference = 1.10, p = .02). DISCUSSION: 
      Perceived cognitive decline is prevalent in patients with MM during active 
      treatment (<6 months), but not during the maintenance phase of MM treatment 
      (>6 months). However, findings predominantly rely on self-reported cognitive 
      outcomes, rather than objective assessments, which may limit reliability. More 
      RCTs are needed to investigate domain-specific cognitive impacts using 
      standardized objective measures. In addition, comparisons of cognitive outcomes 
      relative to age/education-matched healthy controls should be made to evaluate 
      cancer-related cognitive impairment.

AB  - The complement system is a critical component of the immune system, playing a 
      significant role in pathogen defense and immune regulation. In cancer, it has a 
      complex and dual role, either aiding in immune surveillance or contributing to 
      tumor progression and immune evasion, depending on the specific context. While 
      genetic and epigenetic regulation of complement-related genes has been studied in 
      various diseases, its influence on cancer remains underexplored. This review 
      focuses on how genetic variants in complement pathway genes may modulate cancer 
      susceptibility, progression, and treatment outcomes. Genome-wide association 
      studies (GWAS) have identified several key single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      linked to complement genes, such as C3, C7, CFHR4 and ITGB2, which could 
      influence immune responses and cancer development. Additionally, epigenetic 
      modifications, such as DNA methylation, have been shown to regulate the 
      expression of complement genes in cancer, adding further complexity to our 
      understanding of their role in tumor immunity. Challenges remain in translating 
      genetic and epigenetic insights into therapeutic strategies. The complex nature 
      of cancer, tissue-specific complement regulation, and the difficulty in 
      identifying reliable biomarkers complicate the development of targeted 
      complement-based therapies for precision medicine. Therefore, future research 
      combining genetic, genomic, and epigenomic data, along with functional genomics 
      and proteomics, is needed to elucidate the potential roles of regulatory variants 
      of complement genes in cancer. In addition to mechanistic studies, this 
      information can be used to guide personalized treatment strategies for cancer 
      patients.

TI  - Age-associated changes in type I collagen promote the invasion of BRAF(V600E) 
      mutated melanoma cells and their resistance to targeted therapies within 
      three-dimensional matrix models.

AB  - Melanoma represents the most aggressive form of skin cancer, with the highest 
      rate of mortality. Anti-mutated BRAF(V600E) therapies, such as vemurafenib, has 
      improved the prognosis for melanoma patients; however, resistance to these 
      targeted therapies frequently emerges. Type I collagen-a key element of the tumor 
      microenvironment-contributes to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. 
      With aging, type I collagen undergoes structural remodeling that alters its 
      fibrillar organization and mechanical properties. Although these changes have 
      been documented, their impact on BRAF(V600E)-mutated melanoma cell behavior and 
      drug response remains unclear. In this study, we utilized both in vitro and in 
      vivo models to fill this critical gap by investigating how collagen remodeling 
      associated with advanced age modulates BRAF(V600E)-mutated melanoma response to 
      vemurafenib. Our findings indicate that in vitro-using a 3D culture matrix 
      model-old collagen promotes increased proliferation of 1205Lu cells and protects 
      both 1205Lu and SKMEL28 cells from vemurafenib effects. This was associated with 
      elevated YAP expression, suggesting a role for mechanotransduction in drug 
      resistance. The 3D collagen matrix spheroid model revealed that aged collagen 
      enhances the invasive properties of 1205Lu cells, which correlated with an 
      upregulation of the AXL receptor. In vivo, vemurafenib reduced tumor growth in 
      athymic mice xenografted with melanoma cells embedded in young collagen matrices, 
      but not in those with aged collagen. Collectively, our data suggest that 
      age-related alterations in type I collagen contribute to reduced efficacy of 
      anti-BRAF(V600E) therapies in BRAF(V600E)-mutated melanoma.

AB  - Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal 
      (GI) malignancies being among the most prevalent and lethal types. Traditional 
      treatments for GI cancers, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, often result in 
      severe side effects due to their lack of specificity. Among the various 
      therapeutic strategies, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising and highly 
      specific approach for treating GI cancers. Immunotherapeutic methods include the 
      use of monoclonal antibodies with diverse specificities, as well as cell-based 
      therapies. Engineered cell therapies, particularly those utilizing chimeric 
      antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, represent a 
      forefront in innovative cancer treatment. While CAR-T cells have shown promise, 
      CAR-NK cells offer distinct advantages, such as the ability to kill tumor cells 
      independently of CAR signaling and their suitability for safe allogeneic 
      transplantation.Given these benefits, CAR-NK cells have gained attention as 
      either a complementary or alternative strategy to CAR-T cell therapy in GI 
      cancers. Despite this potential, a comprehensive review specifically focused on 
      CAR-NK therapy in GI malignancies has been lacking. The present study aims to 
      address this gap by exploring the application of CAR-NK therapy in various GI 
      cancers, including colorectal, pancreatic, hepatocellular, esophageal, gastric, 
      and tongue cancers, highlighting the targeted tumor antigens and recent 
      advancements in the field.

TI  - Brusatol ameliorates irinotecan-induced delayed diarrhea via inhibition of the 
      cGAS-STING pathway and modulation of intestinal flora.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irinotecan, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, has seen its 
      clinical application constrained by delayed diarrhea. Brucea javanica, with 
      documented historical use in dysentery management, demonstrates anticancer 
      synergy in its modern emulsion formulation (BJOE). Brusatol (BR), the primary 
      bioactive compound of B. javanica, possesses anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and 
      anti-diarrheal properties. However, its potential effect on irinotecan-induced 
      delayed diarrhea has yet to be explored. PURPOSE: The objective of this work was 
      to experimentally explore the efficacy and action mechanism of BR in alleviating 
      diarrhea. METHODS: Body weight, DAI score, colon length were measured in 
      irinotecan-induced delayed diarrhea mouse model. The small animal imager was 
      utilized to visualize the distribution of FITC-Dextran, and the serum 
      fluorescence intensity was measured to assess intestinal permeability. 
      Histopathology (HE and PAS staining), immunohistochemistry, and 
      immunofluorescence were performed. Inflammation and barrier indices were 
      evaluated via PCR and ELISA. Molecular docking, the STING agonist DMXAA, and 16S 
      rRNA sequencing were employed to elucidate the possible mechanism. RESULTS: BR 
      markedly ameliorated weight loss, DAI score, and colon length in mice. It also 
      reduced intestinal permeability and pathological injury. The concentration of 
      IL-1beta, IL-6, as well as TNF-alpha was notably reduced by BR, while IL-10 expression 
      was upregulated. The mRNA expression of tight junction markers ZO-1 and occludin 
      was remarkably upregulated by BR. BR effectively restored mucin content in 
      colonic cup cells and increase PCNA protein expression. The suppressive effect of 
      BR on cGAS and STING was significantly reversed by DMXAA, and its effect on 
      reducing colonic dsDNA and IFN-beta protein levels was also markedly attenuated by 
      DMXAA. Promoting STING secretion significantly attenuated the suppressive effect 
      of BR on the cGAS-STING pathway, as evidenced by the increase of mRNA expression 
      of cGAS, STING, CXCL10, CCL5, and IFN-beta, as well as the protein expression of 
      cGAS, STING, p-TBK1, and p-IRF3. Additionally, DMXAA attenuated BR's effect on 
      the abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests 
      that brusatol effectively mitigated irinotecan-induced delayed diarrhea, as least 
      partially, via inhibition of aberrant activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and 
      modulation of intestinal microbiome. Our findings may offer novel insights into 
      the modern use of B. javanica for the treatment of diarrhea and open new avenues 
      for the development of adjuvant anticancer drugs that alleviate 
      irinotecan-induced intestinal adverse effects.
